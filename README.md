# <p align="center"> Collect of Old Codepen HTML Art</p>
This repository is a collection of HTML art projects I did back in 2016, at the age of sixteen.

**Things to Note**:
- The cold present is old, outdated and amateur.
- The files are not linked, they are as present on Codepen.

> In 2016 I was a Sophomore in Highschool. I had just gotten into a Web Design class, which was my introduction to Compsci and programming. I wasn't very good at the latter, with most of my time spent doing HTML art. For some odd reason, the programmatic nature of creating animations through the DOM was actually incredibly fulfilling. I enjoyed coming up with new ideas for things to make, some of which never made it passed fruition or were lost to time. But ultimately, a few of them were around for me to compile.

## <p align="center"> Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door - Dark Wizzerd </p>

> I honestly don't know why, but one day I saw the animation for this enemy while watching someone else play the game. I thought to myself, I can make that work. I didn't make it work exactly, opting to use a front-facing view instead of the angled view they appear as in game. This was my first piece to be entirely animated with so many complex parts. I even learned how to create triangles for this!

## <p align="center"> ZTE Blade Z Max </p>

> This was the phone I carried at the time. You can probably see where the inspiration came from. I originally made a version of the phone I had prior, albeit much less animated (though, I remember, it also had a charger you could plug in). At this point I learned animations were a thing (and not just transitions) so I opted for some more creativity.

## <p align="center"> The Legend of Zelda - 3D Link Sprite </p>

> I could of picked any sprite for this, but for whatever reason I choose Link. I even had some really poorly added music running for awhile from the game. This was inspired after I learned that it was possible to make cubes by abusing the z-index and 3DRotate features of CSS. It felt like I was making a game asset, and still makes me happy to remember the success I felt making something so complex. Even if the HTML was really, really bad.

## <p align="center"> Keypad Game </p>

> I tried a few more things with cubes. They weren't super fast, or useful in most cases, but I got one idea out with them: a keypad game where the goal was to find the code (randomly placed!) in order to win. The colors kind of remind me of the unfinished lighting you would see in games.

## <p align="center"> Mickey Mouse Art </p>

> I actually ended up making this in senior year. I was given a really poorly taught class on Adobe Illustrator, and had to make something for a final. Luckily, the teacher never actually checked to make sure it was really done in AI. So, I went with my most reliable skill at the time, HTML art. While it's honestly very slapped together, I'm still impressed I managed to understand how to make a complex image out of shapes so easily.

## <p align="center"> Six-Sided Die </p>

> More cube stuff. I thought this was really impressive, but honestly had no idea what I was doing with animations. All the animations were predesigned in a way that always felt really unnecessary. But it has personality, and even a shadow!

## <p align="center"> Node AI </p>

> Back then this was the extent of my "AI" knowledge. A _ball_ whose only purpose is to move randomly within a node grid. I tried to give the whole project personality too. The AI even had an internal name, Anni the AI, and would randomly squish while moving around.

## <p align="center"> Node AI </p>

> This project gets an honorable mention; even though it wasn't finished and is rather small, it was fairly creative. I never made a proper saturn ring, but I managed to mess around z-indexes enough to get some cool orbit going.
